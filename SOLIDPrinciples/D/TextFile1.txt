D - dependency inversion principle

that high level modules should not depend on low-level modules both should depend on abstractions

the strategy of depending upon interface or abstract classes rather than upon concrete classes.  decouple 
between modules and promote the use of interfaces or abstract classes to define the dependencies allowing for more
flexable and testable code.
